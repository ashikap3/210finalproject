Analysis of Artist Streaming Data Using Regression and Visualization


The major purpose of this analysis was to look at the correlation between several artist-specific metrics (solo streams, featured streams, and lead streams) and overall Spotify streams. Using the provided dataset, I attempted to study how different cooperation styles affect overall popularity and streaming indicators. The question I was trying to answer was How do collaboration patterns, including solo streams and featured streams, influence an artistâ€™s overall popularity, as measured by total Spotify streams?


The regression models revealed how changes in one measure (such as a rise in solo streams) affected the dependent variable, total streams. These associations were further shown using scatter plots, with regression lines showing the overall patterns. For example, the data might identify whether featured collaborations outperform solo performances in terms of overall streams, or whether being the lead artist on a track has a better link with streaming success.
