Analysis of Artist Streaming Data Using Regression and Visualization


The major purpose of this analysis was to look at the correlation between several artist-specific metrics (solo streams, featured streams, and lead streams) and overall Spotify streams. Using the provided dataset, I attempted to study how different cooperation styles affect overall popularity and streaming indicators. The question I was trying to answer was How do collaboration patterns, including solo streams and featured streams, influence an artistâ€™s overall popularity, as measured by total Spotify streams?
